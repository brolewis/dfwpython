Oracle of Kirk
==============

The [Oracle of Bacon](http://oracleofbacon.org) is a website that shows the degrees of separation between Kevin Bacon and any other actor. As an exercise in data manipulation, I decided to create a similar program for the Star Trek universe. This program utilizes data from IMDB via IMDbPY(http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net) to create a database of characters and appearances.

This code was written for a talk at [DFW Python](http://www.dfwpython.org).
